Software Security

Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
Artemis Financial is a consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for their customers. They want to use the most current and effective software security and are seeking Global Rain’s expertise about how to protect their client data and financial information.

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
I was not able to find the software security vulnerabilities as the code would not compile. Coding securly is important to protect the customers that utilize your programs. The value of applying industry standard best practices for secure coding lies in being able to understand what may be a vulnerability in your code as well as easy means of altering it in the future should you find a critical vulnerability that you want to mitigate.

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you? 
One of the files would not save changes and reverted back to its original state no matter what changes were made making the program unable to compile.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
I could not increase layers of security but attempted to implement AES256 to securly encrypt all user data.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
I wasn't able to make certain that the code and software application were functional. The program never compiled so I was unable to check for new vulnerabilities.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
I was able to learn and understand working with Windows Powershell to generate selfsigned certificates for testing.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
I would show future employers how I was able to generate the selfsigned certificate and explain my thought process for approaching this assigment.
